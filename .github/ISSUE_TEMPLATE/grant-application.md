## Grant name
No-Code Hello World Application 

## Applicant background
QModeler - is a team of 12 blockchain developers working accross the world. We have been working on blockchain projects for 4 years and have built the leading blockchain No-Code development platform QModeler.
 

## Motivation and overview
Adapting our product to the Baseline Protocol will provide our customers with added comfort and reassurance as well as various other benefits, such as the potential of future integratons,that are accrued by adhering to a standard.  For more about the many benefits our customers find in using our market leading product please view our explainer video at the link below.The baseline protocol would benefit by a potentially wider adoption as a consequence of being available to a non-technical audiance. 
Our proposal is to build a Hello World application in our No-Code Platform that deploys to the Ethereum mainnet. This would entail adding new components to our pallet of components and some backend changes that would modify our own architecture that uses a different approach to synching merkle trees. Once built technically nieve users would be able to build sophisticated applications using a drag and drop interface.

## Execution risks
- integration with our proprietary formal verification could involve modification of contracts. 
- documentation of the code is scarce but we can learn the code. 

## Downsides
