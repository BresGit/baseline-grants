## Grant name
No-Code Hello World

## Applicant background
QModeler - is a team of 12 blockchain developers working accross the world. We have been working on blockchain projects for 4 years. 
Our flagship project is QModeler a No-Code protocol platform that already follows the basic design principals as the Baseline Protocol. Although QModeler was designed in 2018 it already has includes of the Baseline Protocol elements in its core architecture. QModeler works by  synching of offline and and online Merkle trees. 


## Motivation and overview
Our proposal is to build a Hello World application in our No-Code Platform that deploys to the Ethereum MainNet. This would entail adding new components to our pallet of components and some backend changes that would modify our own architecture that uses a different approach to synching merkle trees. Once built technically nieve users would be able to build sophisticated applications using a drag and drop interface. 

The power and flexibility provided by No-Code solutions nor can the power of No-Code solutions to push adoption of blockchain solutions and provide 
convenient onboarding of advanced protocols to organizations that lack blockhain resources. 
While there are many No-Code solutions our solutions is the only No-Code solution that is built on turing complete visual languages,that is why we 
say it is more powerful then coding languages. Our customers, Walmart, WellsFargo, Target, US Government,  rely on QModeler to build prototypes and complete applications.
Adapting our product to the Baseline Protocol will provide our customers with added comfort and reassurance  and other benefits such as the potential of future integratons that are accrued by adhering to a standard.  



For more about the many benefits our customers find in using our market leading product please view our explainer video at the link below.

## Execution risks
- integration with our inbuilt formal verification could involve modification of contracts. 
- documentation of the code is scarce but we can learn the code. 

## Downsides


## Tasks and schedule (milestones if applicable)

Milestone  1 -  Modification of QModler Runtime to include  messaging JSON-RPC.
Milestone  2 -   Modification of QModeler Runtime to include persistance libraries
Milestoone 3 Integration of QModeler Smart Contracts and Baseline Smart contracts. 


## Budget and justification
10,000 USD 
We anticipate the work would take 4 backend developers 2 blockchain developers and 4 UI developers working in parallel for 5 weeks. 
Our cost is estimated to be  50K
